.SH NAME
\fBcssdiff\fP \- generate a difference summary of two \&.css files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcssdiff\fP
[cssfile 1]
[cssfile 2]
.SH WARNING
This man page is taken from an older CRM114 version.  It is provided as a
convenience to Debian users and may not be up-to-date.  If you would like to
update it, please send appropriate patches to the Debian bug tracking system.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcssdiff\fP is a special-purpose utility to measure the distance
between the classes represented by cssfile1 and cssfile2\&.
The summary result output tells how many features were in each
of the \&.css files, how many features appeared in both (balanced overlap),
how many features appeared only in one (or unbalanced overlaps), and
how often the feature set of one \&.css file strictly dominated the
feature set of another \&.css file\&.
This set of metrics provides an intuitive way to determine the
similarity (or dissimilarity) of two classes represented as
\&.css files\&.
When using the CRM114 spamfilter, it can be used to find out how easy it will
be for CRM114 to differentiate spam from nonspam with your \&.css files\&.
\fBcssdiff\fP prints a report like e\&.g\&.

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
   Sparse spectra file spam\&.css has 1048577 bins total
   Sparse spectra file nonspam\&.css has 1048577 bins total

   File 1 total features            :      1605968
   File 2 total features            :      1045152

   Similarities between files       :       142039
   Differences between files        :      1279964

   File 1 dominates file 2          :      1463929
   File 2 dominates file 1          :       903113
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

Note that in this case there\&'s a big difference between the two files; in this
case there are about 10 times as many differences between the two files as
there are similarities\&.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no options to cssdiff\&.
.SH SHORTCOMINGS
Note that \fBcssdiff\fP as of version 20040816 is NOT capable of dealing
with the CRM114 Winnow classifier\&'s floating-point \&.cow files\&. Worse,
\fBcssdiff\fP is unaware of it\&'s shortcomings, and will try anyway\&. The only
recourse is to be aware of this issue and not use \fBcssdiff\fP on Winnow
classifier floating point \&.cow format files\&.
