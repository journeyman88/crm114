.SH NAME
\fBcssutil\fP \- utility to measure and manipulate CRM114 statistics files\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcssutil\fP
[\&.css file]
[OPTIONS]
.SH WARNING
This man page is taken from an older CRM114 version.  It is provided as a
convenience to Debian users and may not be up-to-date.  If you would like to
update it, please send appropriate patches to the Debian bug tracking system.
.SH OPTIONS

.ZI 3m "\fB-h\fP"
\&
.br
print basic help
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-b\fP"
\&
.br
brief - print only a summary of the statistics of the
\&.css file (otherwise, prints a full list of how many bins are in each counter
state)
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-q\fP"
\&
.br
quiet mode; no warning messages
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-r\fP"
\&
.br
report then exit (no menu)\&. The default if -r is not
specified is to drop into a command-menu based system\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-s\fP"
\&
.br
if no css file found, create new one with this
many buckets\&. Default is 1 million + 1 buckets
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-S\fP"
\&
.br
same as -s, but round up to next 2^n + 1 boundary\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-v\fP"
\&
.br
print version and exit
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-D\fP"
\&
.br
dump css file to stdout in the architecture-independent
CSV format, suitable for reloading with -R in an architecture\&. (note that \&.css
files are a hardware-architecture dependent format)
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-R\fP"
\&
.br
create and restore css from the
hardware-architecture independent CSV format file (reads from stdin if csv-file
is not supplied\&.
.in -3m
.SH THE COMMAND MENU
If -r is not supplied, a menu appears with the following options\&. Note that
all of these operations are "in place" and surgical- there is NO undo
functionality\&. Wise users will make a backup copy of all \&.css files before
using cssutil to alter values\&.

.ZI 3m "\fB-Z\fP"
\&
.br
zero all bins at or below a value\&. This is useful for
deleting all small-count features from the \&.css statistics files leaving
higher-count features untouched\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-S\fP"
\&
.br
subtract a constant from all bins - this rolls all
features back a constant amount\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-D\fP"
\&
.br
divide all bins by a constant - this rolls features back
linearly, rather than in scalar fashion\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-R\fP"
\&
.br
rescan - regenerate the statistics output that was
initially printed\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-P\fP"
\&
.br
pack - re-slot features to optimize access time\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-Q\fP"
\&
.br
- gracefully exit, saving changes\&. (note that since these
operations are in-place and surgical, there is no option to exit without saving
changes\&.
.in -3m
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcssutil\fP is a general utility to manipulate and measure the \&.css format
statistics files used by CRM114\&'s Markovian and OSB classifiers\&. The biggest
uses are to check the available space remaining in a \&.css file, to selectively
groom a \&.css file, and to port architecture-dependent \&.css files to and from an
ASCII CSV format, which is architecture independent\&.
The \fBcssutil\fP program can be used to create information-less
\&.css files:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
     cssutil -b -r spam\&.css
     cssutil -b -r nonspam\&.css
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

\&. This creates the full-size files \&./spam\&.css and \&./nonspam\&.css,
holding no information\&.
The \fBcssutil\fP program can be used check that the \&.css files are reasonable\&.
Invoke \fBcssutil\fP as:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
    cssutil -b -r spam\&.css
    cssutil -b -r nonspam\&.css
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

You should get back a report something like this:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
     Sparse spectra file spam\&.css statistics:

     Total available buckets          :      1048576
     Total buckets in use             :       506987
     Total hashed datums in file      :      1605968
     Average datums per bucket        :         3\&.17
     Maximum length of overflow chain :           39
     Average length of overflow chain :         1\&.84
     Average packing density          :         0\&.48
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

Note that the packing density is 0\&.48; this means that this \&.css file is about
half full of features\&. Once the packing density gets above about 0\&.9, you will
notice that CRM114 will take longer to process text\&. The penalty is small
below packing densities below about 0\&.95 and only about a factor of 2 at 0\&.97 \&.
Best is to keep it below \&.7 to \&.8\&.
.SH SHORTCOMINGS
Note that \fBcssutil\fP as of version 20040816 is NOT capable of dealing with the
CRM114 Winnow classifier\&'s floating-point \&.cow files\&. Worse, \fBcssutil\fP is
unaware of it\&'s shortcomings, and will try anyway\&. The only recourse is to be
aware of this issue and not use \fBcssutil\fP on a Winnow classifier floating point
\&.cow format file\&.
